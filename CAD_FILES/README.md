Source files for the Rostock MAX Delta 3D Printer by SeeMeCNC
These files are distibuted GPL, feel free to enjoy, but give credit where due.


The DXFs folder contains the 4 lasercut sheets needed to cut the parts for a Rostock MAX.

Sheets 1 thru 3 are 18" x 32" x .270" thick melamine laminate, and the files have been optimized for
that material.  It also works with 1/4" acrylic, however the tabs are slightly oversized for 1/4" material.
